> [!NOTE]
> **Java Edition:** This repository is [LYF-023015/OpenGIS](https://github.com/LYF-023015/OpenGIS), a Java-backend evolution of the original [ATFfang/OpenGIS](https://github.com/ATFfang/OpenGIS). The production desktop app now runs a bundled Java 21 / Spring Boot sidecar; the former Python backend remains in the repository only as an explicit recovery and compatibility backup. The current validated release target is Windows.

### Java Edition quick start

Requirements: Windows, Node.js 18+, JDK 21, and Git. Maven is provided through the repository wrapper.

```powershell
npm install
java-backend\mvnw.cmd --batch-mode verify
npm run dev:electron
```

Build the Windows package with `npm run dist:win`. See [`java-backend/README.md`](java-backend/README.md) for the module layout and [`docs/migration/phase10/README.md`](docs/migration/phase10/README.md) for migration and release evidence.

## 1. Introduction

OpenGIS is an Agent-based open-source GIS desktop application. It is not a simple "map + chat box" — it brings **GIS data management, map rendering, spatial analysis, cartographic export, workflows, background workers, reusable operations, memory systems, and tool governance** together in a single desktop environment.

The project is under active development. The current goal is not to replace all capabilities of ArcGIS Pro / QGIS, but to explore a more natural way of working with GIS: users describe intent in natural language, and the Agent reads data, runs code, calls map capabilities, generates charts, accumulates scripts and Operations within a governed tool system — with results displayed directly on the map, in chat, dashboards, or the cartographic canvas.

## 2. Feature Overview

### 2.1 Agent Capabilities

- **Function-call Agent Loop**: Structured tool calls as the primary path, avoiding the old CodeAct era of guessing code blocks and tool calls from plain text.
- **Code Execution**: Controlled Python execution for ad-hoc GIS analysis, data cleaning, charting, and long-tail algorithm validation.
- **Tool Governance**: All tools go through unified schema, permissions, result normalization, event archiving, and frontend display.
- **Plan / Sub-Agent / Workflow**: Plan, Subagent, and Workflow all share the same session / run / MessagePart protocol.
- **Memory & Knowledge Retention**: Structured MemoryStore, ContextProjector, KnowledgeExtractor, and FailureMemory jointly manage context and experience.
- **Operation Reuse**: A complex analysis can be distilled into an editable, verifiable, runnable, workspace-shareable Operation.
- **Worker Background Tasks**: With user approval, the Agent can create / restart / pause / delete resident Python Workers for dynamic data ingestion and real-time map rendering.

### 2.2 GIS & Map Capabilities

- **Vector Data**: GeoJSON, CSV, Shapefile, KML, GeoPackage, and other common formats.
- **Raster Data**: GeoTIFF / TIFF parsing, hybrid frontend/backend rendering, server-side tiles, color ramps, and transparency control.
- **Map Rendering**: MapLibre GL JS with point / line / polygon, categorized styling, graduated styling, size variables, opacity variables, ordering variables, labels, filters, and highlights.
- **Dynamic Maps**: Workers continuously push `rpc.ui.map.dynamic_layer_update` via stdout JSON protocol for real-time layer updates.
- **3D View**: Map pitch / bearing control with basic extrusion styles.
- **Cartographic Canvas**: Layout Composer supports map frames, scale bars, north arrows, legends, canvas ratios, image export, and is designed for ArcGIS / QGIS-style extensibility.
- **Data Pivot**: Layers / files can open a data pivot panel with tables, statistics, field distributions, and Agent analysis results displayed separately.

### 2.3 Automation & Extensibility

- **Workflow**: DAG-based multi-step analysis where nodes describe what they receive from upstream and what they output.
- **Operation**: Software-level atomic operations with input/output schemas, dependencies, code, documentation, and run history.
- **Worker**: Resident Java worker processes for real-time data, API polling, and dynamic rendering.
- **Project Skills**: Skills are project-level capability / knowledge packages, distinct from tools. Tools are functions the Agent can call directly; Skills are user-injected context, flows, constraints, or capability sets.
- **Run Archive**: Every Agent execution round is archived as an event stream of tool calls, MessageParts, artifacts, and metadata.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Process Model

OpenGIS uses an **Electron shell + React Renderer + Spring Boot Java backend** architecture:

```text
Electron Main
  ├─ Window, menu, file system, settings, Java backend lifecycle
  │
  └─ Renderer (React + TypeScript)
       ├─ MapLibre map rendering
       ├─ Chat / MessagePart UI
       ├─ Layers, assets, Operation, Workflow, Worker, Layout Composer
       └─ JSON-RPC Dispatcher: handles Java -> UI reverse RPC

Java Backend (Spring Boot + Spring AI)
  ├─ WebSocket JSON-RPC service
  ├─ Agent loop / session / memory / tool runtime
  ├─ GIS / OSM / datasource / raster / operation / workflow / worker integration
  └─ Java Worker processes
```

| Layer | Technology | Responsibilities | Key Directories |
|---|---|---|---|
| Electron Main | Electron 30 + Node | Window, menu, IPC, Java backend lifecycle | `electron/` |
| Renderer | React 18 + TypeScript + Zustand | UI, map, layer state, reverse RPC handlers | `src/features/`, `src/services/`, `src/stores/` |
| Map Engine | MapLibre GL JS | WebGL map, source/layer sync, export | `src/features/map/` |
| Java Backend | Java 21 + Spring Boot + Spring AI | JSON-RPC, Agent, Tool, Workflow, GIS, Worker | `java-backend/` |
| Java Worker | Java process | Background dynamic data, continuous rendering | `java-backend/opengis-worker/` |

### 3.2 Communication: Bidirectional JSON-RPC

The Renderer and Java backend communicate over a single WebSocket channel using JSON-RPC 2.0, supporting both directions:

```text
Renderer -> Java
  chat.user_message
  rpc.code.run_script
  rpc.runs.list / get
  rpc.agent.*
  rpc.worker.*

Java -> Renderer
  rpc.ui.map.add_layer_from_geojson
  rpc.ui.map.dynamic_layer_update
  rpc.ui.map.set_layer_style
  rpc.ui.ask.*
  chat / event notification
```

The frontend `src/services/pythonClient.ts` handles WebSocket connection, request timeouts, notification dispatch, and dynamic map event buffering. Inbound `rpc.ui.*` notifications go to `src/services/rpc/handlers/` and ultimately write to Zustand stores or directly invoke MapEngine.

Key principles:

- **Map state lives in the frontend**: Python does not hold MapLibre handles; all layer state is authoritative in the frontend store.
- **Heavy computation in Python**: Spatial analysis, raster processing, model inference, Operations, and Workers run in Python.
- **UI operations via reverse RPC**: Python tools command the frontend to load layers, update styles, and switch views through `rpc.ui.map.*`.
- **Dynamic data via notification stream**: Worker stdout outputs one line of JSON; the sidecar parses and forwards it to the frontend dynamic handler.

### 3.3 Agent Architecture

The Agent has been upgraded from the old CodeAct to a mainstream function-call architecture with the following layered design:

```text
AgentProfile
  -> SessionCoordinator
  -> SpringAiAgentRunner / ChatClient
  -> RunLifecycleAdvisor
  -> ToolCallingAdvisor / OpenGisToolCallingManager
  -> ToolRuntime / PermissionRuntime
  -> EventLog / RunArchive / MessagePart
```

| Module | Responsibilities | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| `opengis-agent` | Spring AI Agent runner, SessionCoordinator, RuntimeControl, context and archives | `java-backend/opengis-agent/` |
| `opengis-tool` | ToolRuntime, schema validation, permission and artifact handling | `java-backend/opengis-tool/` |
| `opengis-ai` | Spring AI model configuration and provider projection | `java-backend/opengis-ai/` |
| `opengis-workflow` | Workflow model, storage, output passing and DAG orchestration | `java-backend/opengis-workflow/` |

#### 3.3.1 Function-call First

OpenGIS now uses function calls as the primary Agent path. The model outputs structured tool calls, and the framework executes tools by schema and returns structured results. Python code execution remains a tool but is no longer the loop control protocol.

This addresses several issues from the old CodeAct:

- Agent reply text is no longer mistakenly executed as Python code.
- Tool parameters are constrained by schema, not natural language parsing.
- The frontend can uniformly display tools, code, artifacts, Operations, Workers, and errors.
- Permission approval, tool pruning, result compression, and run archiving all have unified entry points.

#### 3.3.2 MessagePart Display Protocol

Agent output is no longer a single mixed block of text, but event-driven `MessagePart[]`:

| Part Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `text` | Normal Agent reply |
| `tool` | Tool call and result |
| `code` | Generated / executed Python code |
| `artifact` | Images, reports, files, layers, etc. |
| `operation` | Operation run block |
| `progress` | Current bottom status bar |
| `plan` | Plan / Workflow progress |
| `error` | Errors and interruptions |

The frontend Chat directly renders MessageParts. Default tool calls are collapsed; Python code is collapsible; execution output is compressed by default; images and locally-referenced Markdown resources are rendered through secure path conversion.

#### 3.3.3 Loop Convergence & Anomaly Protection

The Agent loop does not rely on hard-coded step limits. Instead, it converges based on:

- The model naturally stops with no tool calls.
- TurnObjective / DeviationGuard detects goal deviation.
- Loop Anomaly Detector catches repeated tools, repeated failures, and invalid retries.
- RuntimeControl performs health checks and graceful shutdown for long-running tasks like Workers and Operations.
- ToolRuntime provides structured feedback on errors, encouraging fixes to the original file / Operation rather than circumventing it.

### 3.4 Boundaries: Tool, Skill, Operation

Current naming conventions:

| Name | Definition | Example | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tool** | A function the Agent can call directly, with schema, permissions, and result structure | `read_file`, `edit_file`, `add_layer`, `start_worker` | Built into code |
| **Skill** | A user / project injectable knowledge, flow, constraint, or capability package that can influence context and tool selection | External skill packages, project-level docs | Project / user level |
| **Operation** | A reusable software-level atomic operation with input/output schemas, dependencies, main program, docs, and run history | DBSCAN clustering, KDE, format conversion | Built-in + workspace |
| **Workflow** | DAG multi-step task orchestration where nodes define input/output descriptions | Academic reports, watershed analysis | `.flow.json` |
| **Worker** | A resident Python service for continuous data processing and dynamic rendering | Flight tracking, dynamic points, real-time trajectories | Workspace |

Legacy code sometimes called tools "skills." In the new architecture, avoid mixing: **Tools are tools, external capability packages are Skills, reusable algorithms are Operations.**

### 3.5 Tool Runtime

Tools are centralized in `java-backend/opengis-tool/`, with GIS tools in `java-backend/opengis-gis/`:

| Tool Group | Representative Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|
| File | `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_directory`, `glob`, `grep` | Fuzzy matching, diff output, read protection, file suggestions |
| Shell | `bash` | Shell execution with permission governance and risk prompts |
| Web | `webfetch`, `websearch` | Fetch web pages, real-time search |
| Map | `list_layers`, `add_layer`, `update_layer_style`, `set_categorized_style`, `set_graduated_style`, `set_layer_order` | Operate frontend maps via reverse RPC |
| Raster | `add_raster`, `get_raster_info`, `set_raster_style` | TIFF / GeoTIFF / server-side tiles / color ramps |
| OSM | `osm_call` | Nominatim + Overpass for OSM data |
| DataSource | `datasource_call` | Built-in data sources |
| Workflow | `create_workflow`, `run_workflow`, etc. | Create, read, save, execute Workflows |
| Operation | `list_operations`, `run_operation`, `edit_operation`, `validate_operation` | Run and maintain reusable operations |
| Worker | `start_worker`, `start_dynamic_map_worker`, `restart_worker`, `wait_worker_update`, `pause_worker`, `delete_worker` | Resident background services |
| Report | `export_map_snapshot`, `write_report_section`, `export_report_pdf` | Reports and export |
| Subagent | `run_subagent` | Sub-agent execution |
| Debug | `debug_agent_context` | Context and tool exposure debugging |

ToolRuntime is responsible for:

- Registering Python functions as LLM-visible JSON schemas.
- Performing parameter validation and permission decisions before execution.
- Normalizing output, truncating large results, and generating artifact pointers after execution.
- Writing tool calls / results to RunArchive and MessagePart.
- Projecting frontend UI events into a unified stream.

### 3.6 Memory & Context

The new memory system is no longer centered on injecting a single `memory.md`, but is organized in layers:

```text
MemoryStore
  facts          # Stable facts: projects, files, layers, user preferences
  recipes        # Reusable operation steps and debugging experience
  dataset_cards  # Dataset field, range, statistical summary, path
  failure_memory # Repeated errors, failure causes, fix suggestions

ContextProjector
  -> Retrieves relevant memory based on current user intent
  -> Combines recent turns / working state / artifacts
  -> ProviderProjector generates the complete provider request
```

Key points:

- **Task-based retrieval**: Not all history is stuffed into the system prompt; relevant facts are selected per turn.
- **Complete request budget**: Context trimming considers not just message history, but also system prompt, tools, memory, artifacts, and provider format.
- **Failure memory**: Consecutive tool failures, missing packages, and signature misuse accumulate as failure memory to avoid repeating mistakes.
- **Knowledge extraction**: After a run, KnowledgeExtractor extracts facts, recipes, and dataset cards.
- **User instructions**: Global preferences and project-level preferences are managed separately.

### 3.7 RunArchive & Event-Sourced UI

Every Agent run writes to `.opengis/runs/<run_id>/`:

```text
meta.json
events.jsonl
message_parts.jsonl
tool_calls.jsonl
artifacts.jsonl
steps.jsonl
```

This event-sourced structure enables the frontend to:

- Render Chat in real time.
- Recover historical runs.
- Display tool calls, code, Operations, Workers, and Artifacts.
- Detect abnormal endings and backfill running status.
- Offload long outputs to artifact pointers to prevent UI and context from freezing on large JSON.

### 3.8 Workflow Architecture

Workflow is DAG orchestration, not simple prompt templates. Each node needs to describe:

- What it receives from upstream.
- What task it executes.
- What it outputs to downstream.
- Whether to retry on failure.

Workflow files are typically stored as `.flow.json`. Built-in workflows are located in project resources or the workspace's `.opengis/workflows/`. Users can also have the Agent create and save workflows.

Execution flow:

```text
Workflow document
  -> parse nodes / edges
  -> topological sort
  -> node session
  -> node output summary + artifact
  -> downstream context
  -> final report
```

The frontend Workflow UI and Plan UI share the MessagePart protocol but display differently: Workflow emphasizes DAG progress, Plan emphasizes current task steps.

### 3.9 Operation Architecture

Operation is a more stable reuse unit than scripts. It distills a complex exploration into a reusable, modifiable, verifiable atomic capability.

An Operation contains:

```text
operation/
  manifest.json      # Name, description, input/output schema, dependencies, version
  main.py            # Single entry point
  README.md          # Usage instructions
  examples/          # Example parameters
  runs/              # Run history
```

Two types of Operations:

- **Built-in Operations**: Shipped with OpenGIS source, shared across all workspaces.
- **Workspace Operations**: Created in user projects, can be promoted to built-in.

The Agent can:

- Query Operations.
- Construct parameters by schema and run.
- Read Operation code and fix after a failed run.
- Promote stable scripts to Operations.

The frontend Operation panel uses a list + detail structure, and Chat also displays run status and results as independent Operation blocks.

### 3.10 Worker Architecture

Worker is a resident Python service suitable for:

- Continuously polling external APIs.
- Real-time reading of dynamic data.
- Continuous data stream processing.
- Pushing dynamic points, trajectories, and status to the map.

Worker service package structure:

```text
worker/<name>-<worker_id>/
  main.py              # Single entry point
  opengis_worker.py    # Auto-generated OpenGIS helper, should not be manually edited
  config.json          # worker_id, interval_seconds, layer ids, API parameters
  manifest.json        # Service metadata, permissions, dynamic layer declarations
  README.md
  stdout.log
  stderr.log
  metadata.json
  src/
    datasource.py      # Data fetching
    service.py         # State and business logic
    publisher.py       # OpenGIS output adapter
```

Dynamic map protocol:

```python
from opengis_worker import emit_moving_objects

emit_moving_objects(
    point_layer_id="live_points",
    track_layer_id="live_tracks",
    points=[{"id": "p1", "lon": 121.5, "lat": 31.2}],
    tracks={"p1": [[121.5, 31.2], [121.51, 31.21]]},
    sequence=1,
)
```

The helper outputs to stdout:

```json
{"opengis_method":"rpc.ui.map.dynamic_layer_update","params":{...}}
```

The worker manager parses stdout, supplements `worker_id`, `worker_name`, `workspace_path`, `worker_started_at`, and forwards to the frontend. The frontend dynamic handler updates the layer store and instantly syncs MapLibre sources.

Constraints:

- Default max of two running workers.
- Start, restart, pause, and delete require permission governance.
- Background continuous tasks must use workers, not `execute_code`.
- Entry point must be `main.py`; auxiliary modules are allowed but multiple entry points are not.

### 3.11 Map & Rendering Architecture

The frontend map is managed by `src/features/map/engine/MapEngine.ts`. Renderers are split across `src/features/map/renderers/`:

| Renderer | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `circleRenderer` | Points / multi-points |
| `lineRenderer` | Lines / multi-lines |
| `fillRenderer` | Polygons |
| `categorizedRenderer` | Categorized coloring |
| `graduatedRenderer` | Numeric graduated |
| `symbolRenderer` | Icons / labels |
| `rasterRenderer` | Raster |
| `extrusionRenderer` | 3D extrusion |

Layer data parsing is in `src/services/geo/parsers/`. Large vector data uses handle-based strategies to avoid repeatedly stuffing entire GeoJSON into the React store. Raster data supports both frontend parsing and backend server-side tile paths.

The style system supports:

- Point color, size, opacity, stroke.
- Line color, width, opacity, dashes.
- Fill, border, separate fill and border opacity.
- Categorized and graduated coloring, explicit color mapping.
- Size variables, opacity variables, ordering variables.
- Labels / symbols / legends / filters.

### 3.12 Raster Architecture

Raster loading uses a hybrid frontend/backend strategy:

- **Frontend lightweight parsing**: Suitable for small GeoTIFFs, using `geotiff.js` to read and render as image sources.
- **Backend RasterService**: Suitable for larger TIFF / multi-band data; reads statistics, generates tiles, applies color ramps.
- **Style editing**: Supports ramp, custom stops, source value stops, transparency, and stretch min/max.
- **Agent awareness**: `get_raster_info` lets the Agent read dimensions, bands, statistics, and color ramp state.

Mainstream WebGIS typically renders server-side rasters as PNG / JPEG tiles or Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF window reads. OpenGIS currently uses PNG tiles and image sources, with potential future enhancement for COG / pyramids / overviews.

### 3.13 Layout Composer

Layout Composer is a canvas system for cartographic export, targeting the basic mapping workflow of ArcGIS / QGIS:

- Define canvas ratios: 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, custom.
- Add map frames with adjustable position, size, and internal viewport.
- Add scale bars, north arrows, legends.
- Adjust background, borders, fonts, colors, transparency.
- Export images.
- Expose canvas elements as Agent tools for natural-language cartography.

Current implementation is in `src/features/layout-composer/`.

### 3.14 Permissions & Security

OpenGIS is not a hard sandbox product, but provides multiple safety layers:

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| WebSocket | Local loopback + startup token |
| ToolRuntime | Tool permission policy: ask / allow / deny |
| Shell / File | Risk action logging, approval UI, read-before-write protection |
| Worker | Start / restart / delete approval, max running limit |
| RunArchive | Complete event and tool call audit trail |
| Workspace | Git snapshot, rollback capable |
| JavaScript Execution | Isolated child JVM, interruptible, process tree cleanup |

### 3.15 Project Directory

## 4. Getting Started

### 4.1 Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js | >= 18 | Yes | Frontend, Electron, build |
| Java | 21 | Yes | Spring Boot backend, Agent, GIS and workers |
| Git | Any | Yes | Workspace snapshot / run rollback |
| LLM API Key | OpenAI / Anthropic / DeepSeek / MiniMax / GLM / Ollama, etc. | Required for Agent | Basic map features do not require LLM |
| GDAL-compatible native libraries | Platform dependent | Optional | Additional raster/vector format capabilities |

### 4.2 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd OpenGIS
```

### 4.3 Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4.4 Install Python Backend Environment

```bash
npm run setup:python
```

This command creates a shared virtual environment in the user data directory and installs Python dependencies. Both dev mode and packaged applications reuse this environment, avoiding the need to maintain two sets of Python dependencies between source and installed locations.

Typical paths:

```text
macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/opengis/venv
Windows: %APPDATA%/opengis/venv
Linux:   ~/.config/opengis/venv
```

If GDAL, Fiona, or Rasterio fail to install on Windows / macOS, use conda for binary dependencies first:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge geopandas rasterio fiona pyproj shapely -y
npm run setup:python
```

### 4.5 Start Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev:electron
```

Startup sequence:

1. electron-vite starts the renderer dev server.
2. Compiles Electron main / preload.
3. Electron main launches the Java backend.
4. Renderer connects to the backend WebSocket via token.

Once the window and Java backend ready status appear, you're good to go.

### 4.6 Configure the Model

Open Settings / Model:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Provider | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, MiniMax, GLM, Ollama, etc. |
| Protocol | OpenAI Compatible or Anthropic Compatible |
| Base URL | Model service endpoint |

### 4.7 Open a Workspace

Use File / Open Workspace to select a project directory. OpenGIS creates `.opengis/` under the workspace:

```text
.opengis/
  runs/
  workflows/
  operations/
  contexts/
  memory/
  permissions.json
  map-layers.json
```

Different workspaces have independent layers, runs, Operations, workflows, and memory.

## 5. Development Guide

### 5.1 Common Commands

```bash
npm run dev:electron     # Start desktop dev mode
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type checking
npm test                 # Frontend unit tests
npm run build            # Build main / preload / renderer
npm run dist:mac         # macOS packaging
npm run dist:win         # Windows packaging
npm run dist:linux       # Linux packaging
```

Backend tests:

```powershell
cd java-backend
./mvnw.cmd verify
```

### 5.2 Adding a Tool

1. Implement `OpenGisTool` in `java-backend/opengis-tool/` (or `opengis-gis/` for GIS tools).
2. Declare its `ToolDefinition`, JSON schema, group and risk level.
3. Access workspace, cancellation and UI RPC via `ToolExecutionContext`.
4. For map operations, prefer sending `rpc.ui.map.*` reverse RPC; do not maintain map state in Python.
5. Add tests covering at least parameter validation and return structure.

### 5.3 Adding Map Capabilities

Map capabilities typically require changes on both sides:

1. Backend tool: Declare the Agent-callable entry point.
2. Frontend RPC handler: Receive `rpc.ui.map.*` in `src/services/rpc/handlers/map/`.
3. Store: Extend `MapLayerDefinition` or `LayerStyle` if needed.
4. Renderer: Extend MapLibre paint / layout in `src/features/map/renderers/`.
5. UI: If users need manual control, add an edit entry in the layer or style panel.

### 5.4 Adding an Operation

Built-in Operations go in:

```text
java-backend/opengis-gis/src/main/java/org/opengis/gis/operation/builtin/
```

Recommended structure:

```text
MyOperation.java
```

`manifest.json` should clearly describe:

- Input schema.
- Output schema.
- Java/runtime dependencies.
- Operation description.
- Applicable scenarios.

### 5.5 Adding Worker Scenarios

Workers should not be written as a single large script. Recommended structure:

```text
main.py              # Load config, start loop
src/datasource.py    # Fetch data
src/service.py       # Update state, trajectories, filters
src/publisher.py     # emit_dynamic_points / emit_moving_objects
```

Dynamic maps must ensure:

- Stable layer IDs.
- Full first frame, subsequent diffs, or use high-level helpers for automatic handling.
- Stable feature IDs.
- Monotonically increasing sequence.
- Do not write infinite loops in `execute_code`.

### 5.6 Windows Notes

- Paths may contain spaces and Chinese characters; use `Path` / JSON parameters, not shell string concatenation.
- Python venv paths and Electron packaging paths differ; avoid hardcoding macOS paths.
- Subprocess cancellation on Windows uses `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` and `taskkill /F /T`; consider process tree cleanup when adding background processes.
- GDAL / Rasterio are recommended to use precompiled wheels or conda-forge.

## 6. Roadmap

- More complete dynamic map protocol: frontend source diff adapter, state monitoring, Worker debug loop.
- Stronger Operation marketplace: versioning, dependency locking, visual parameter forms, run benchmarks.
- More complete Layout Composer: legend grouping, map bookmarks, multi-page, PDF export.
- Larger data rendering: vector tiles, WebGL aggregation, deck.gl / custom high-performance rendering evaluation.
- Stronger raster pyramids: COG, overviews, server-side window reads, time-series rasters.
- More mature skills integration: project-level skill registry, skill marketplace, permission isolation.
- Stricter permission modes: configurable approval, persistent authorization, risk rule templates.
