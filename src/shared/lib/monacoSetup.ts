/**
 * Monaco local bootstrap — must be imported exactly once, before any
 * component from ``@monaco-editor/react`` is rendered.
 *
 * Why this file exists
 * --------------------
 * By default, ``@monaco-editor/react`` lazy-loads the Monaco runtime
 * from a jsDelivr CDN (``https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/.../vs/loader.js``).
 * Our Electron app ships a strict CSP in ``index.html``:
 *
 *     script-src 'self' 'sha256-…'
 *
 * So the CDN fetch is blocked and the editor never mounts — that is the
 * error you saw:
 *
 *     Refused to load the script 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/...loader.js'
 *     because it violates the following Content Security Policy ...
 *
 * Fix: bundle ``monaco-editor`` locally (already ``npm install``-ed) and
 * hand it to the React wrapper via ``loader.config({ monaco })``. After
 * that, Monaco lives entirely inside our own bundle — no network I/O,
 * no CSP violations, and offline-first (important for a desktop GIS
 * workstation).
 *
 * Workers
 * -------
 * Monaco's language services (TS/JSON/CSS/HTML + editor core) run in
 * Web Workers. Vite handles worker bundling natively via the
 * ``?worker`` suffix. We wire them up through ``MonacoEnvironment`` so
 * the editor can spawn the correct worker per language.

// renders; we guarantee that by importing this file from ``main.tsx``

// Kick off initialization eagerly so the first editor open is instant.
// (``loader.init()`` resolves when monaco is ready; we don't need to
// await it, we only need the side effect.)
